# Processor_Cache
COP290 Project

This is a processor and cache simulator written in C. The processor simulator simulates a 5 stage pipeline taking ARM instructions. 
A SVG file is created which shows the instructions in various parts of the pipeline at each timestep. Users can step through the instructions at will.
The cache simulator measures the number of cache hits, misses etc for various cache configurations.
